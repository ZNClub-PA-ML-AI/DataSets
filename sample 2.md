#A budget for the banking sector.
##Overall, estimated capital requirement for the banking system is between Rs2.5 trillion and Rs3 trillion over the next four years compared with the government’s promise of Rs70,000 crore.
An investment recovery and the health of the banking system are inextricably linked. The banking industry needs cash. Bloated with bad loans, state-owned banks require Rs.1 trillion in the near term, estimate brokerage firms and rating agencies. The government, on the other hand, has allotted only Rs.25,000 crore for this year under its so-called Indradhanush programme.

Consider this statistic: In the December quarter alone, banks posted a cumulative loss of Rs.10,911 crore, which is slightly over two-fifths of government’s proposed capital infusion. Credit Suisse estimates that unprovided problem loans are now at 65-200% of public sector banks’ capital.

The capital requirement will grow further as most banks are yet to recognize some more bad loans. The chart shows how badly banks need capital. Overall, estimated capital requirement for the banking system is between Rs.2.5 trillion and Rs.3 trillion over the next four years compared with the government’s promise of Rs.70,000 crore.
