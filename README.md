# Target - NSE CNX Nifty 50

Here is a breakdown of the 50 companies which constitute the CNX Nifty. Over the last decade, while sectoral weight-age has remained largely similar, the constituent companies have constantly changed.

NSE has announced the following changes in the composition of Nifty 50 index. The replacement of stocks in the index, change in weightage of existing companies will be effective from April 1, 2016.

The inclusion of Tata Motors Ltd (DVR) in the Nifty 50 will take the number of securities in the index to 51.

## Notable Facts:
* Financial Services and Information Technology contribute 40.81% to the overall weight-age.
* There are 5 Pharmaceutical companies. India is amongst the biggest pharmaceutical exporters in the world.
* Of all things,  cigarettes still have a dominant weight-age in the pie.
* No modern day e-commerce businesses find place in the CNX Nifty. Compare this with the U.S. where Facebook, Amazon, e-Bay and Yahoo are all part of the NASDAQ 100.
* The breakup hardly showcases India as a developing economy. Construction, Infrastructure, Industrial manufacturing and cement put together contribute 6.09%. Energy and power is at 15.17%
* 6 out of the 10 financial services companies are private sector banks. Consider the fact that in India, there are 24 listed public sector banks and only 16 listed private sector banks. This is significantly different from how things were a decade back.
