NSE has announced the following changes in the composition of Nifty 50 index. The replacement of stocks in the index, change in weightage of existing companies will be effective from April 1, 2016.

The inclusion of Tata Motors Ltd (DVR) in the Nifty 50 will take the number of securities in the index to 51.

## Notable Facts:

* There are 5 Pharmaceutical companies. India is amongst the biggest pharmaceutical exporters in the world.
* Of all things,  cigarettes still have a dominant weight-age in the pie.
* No modern day e-commerce businesses find place in the CNX Nifty. Compare this with the U.S. where Facebook, Amazon, e-Bay and Yahoo are all part of the NASDAQ 100.
* The breakup hardly showcases India as a developing economy. Construction, Infrastructure, Industrial manufacturing and cement put together contribute 6.09%. Energy and power is at 15.17%
