# This is a sample .condarc file. It adds the r Anaconda.org channel and enables
# the show_channel_urls option.

# channel locations. These override conda defaults, i.e., conda will
# search *only* the channels listed here, in the order given. Use "defaults" to
# automatically include all default channels. Non-url channels will be
# interpreted as Anaconda.org usernames (this can be changed by modifying the
# channel_alias key; see below). The default is just 'defaults'.
#channels:
#  - r
#  - defaults

# Show channel URLs when displaying what is going to be downloaded and
# in 'conda list'. The default is False.
#show_channel_urls: True
